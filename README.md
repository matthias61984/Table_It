# TableIt
TableIt is a new application we're calling "Yelp for millenials." Users log in and are shown local restaurants that they can then like or dislike. Restaurants are generated from the zomato API based on lat/long location and resented to the user to review. Click the green chevron to favorite a restaurant or the red chevron to pass. Liking a restaurant moves it into a favorites array that is then displayed on the favorites tab of the app. On the favorites tab, th euser may sort by cuisine type using the buttons at the top of the window.
